This is an object detection application that uses OpenCV and numpy modules to detect real-time objects present.
The objects present in the frame are outlined and the name of the object is written on the top.
(For example, if a person is present the output will specify "I found a person")
I have also used gtts and playsound module to convert the text into speech. The same is printed as well.
I hope you enjoy using this application :)
